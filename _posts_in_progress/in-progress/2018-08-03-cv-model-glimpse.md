Recently, I have time to have a skimmed  several computer vision papers. And now it's time to make some notes.

[1 Focal Loss for  Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02002.pdf), best student paper that year, it's a very valuable idea to think out improving the object detection accuracy by decreasing the loss of the right classified. The author uses a exponential factor to decreasing the that loss. Because
