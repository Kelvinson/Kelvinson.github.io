title: Summary On Recent Life

Life changed since I come to Pittsburgh, I live in the living room and just turn day and night around.
I don't know how I do this, I am very anxious about my homework and cannot go sleep every night until 
I stayed up late and fall asleep in the morning. I have become a Christian. One big difference between
me and other guys in this school, I guess is that I have received so much help from help from others
to become what I am today. Sometimes I think what if life goes any other way in my 
previous 
life? Any one of that happens I will 
not be here. But there is no if in life. What I can do now is make the most of today, not tomorrow. 
Also, why not believe in God, even if I am not sure whether it exists there are so many people worthy
of being loved, it does not matter to love an additional one. This one just lets me 
know how small and powerless I am and I have to be graceful for what I have today.  

On the other hand, I doubt about my future now. To be a professional SWE seems 
unrealistic to me 
because I think I haven't been equiped with the neccessary skills for SWE at the moment. Just like I said,
life goes on whether I am equiped or not with the skills. Thousands of students are pushing their skills to
be SWE at the moment. 

There are always lovely things happening. Today I wanted to buy takeout food via Venmo 
but I didn't take
wallet with me. By the time I got out, all the takeout food vans had gone away, I then 
turned 
into
 the
 UC 
hall resturant.
Since the UC resturant only accepts credit card and apply pay. I have to ask others how to use apply pay.
I spent much time settping up apple pay, but it didn't work. Finally the owner just let me take the food away
and pay next time. I was very surprised and thankful to the owner. 

No matter how you view you the world and how well you think you know the world, there is always some suprise
for me, learn to be thankful and postive!
