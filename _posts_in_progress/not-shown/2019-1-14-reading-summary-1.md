I have a bookmark, on it says "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts" and "We are all the
products of our own thoughts. Whatever we concentrate upon, what we are" on its back. I totally agree, in today's world,
the external conditions can barely restrict your happiness, unless you have a special substantial requirement, then what
left to determine whether we are happy or not is our thoughts. Yes, what we are thinking in the current moment and the next
moment. However, just like many people in my home city, many of us are always feeling anxious about their lives, their children,
the price change of their houses, etc. I am board of this kind of life. Although I constantly have many work to do. I often
given myself enough time to myself, either reading others' tweets or reading. "Reading or travelling, there is always one
on the way". So far in 2019, I have read "Every day" and "The Great Gatesby". I am reading "To kill a mockingbirdg" and 
"The Help" recently.

### Every Day 
To be honest, I have even been touched to cry when reading this book. When finishing it I even want to watch the moive,
but I eventually gave up the movie since it's too far away from what I imagine.what we see is the touching love
 between a pair of American teens, under the hood are depicts of life of contemporary  American teens, varing in race, 
 color, appearance. As a foreigner, I can have peek into the teenagers' inner world of
 the country. The girl often comes into my mind when I walking, what a love story!

### The Great Gatesby
Are you first remembering the Leonardo's champagne gif when talking about this book? Gatesby is a very thin book, I only
spent about one day seriously finishing reading it. "Great" Gateby and great 
"American Goldrush". The tragedy of the ambitious young man reflects many people's inner world when America is embracing 
a fast development time. I can feel the wide energy of New York City from the book in that age. It's kind of similar to 
the background of "Godfather". Beside that, being honest and keeping neutral is always the theme of traditional
 literatures just like "Forrest Gump".
