I come from Southwest China, Sichuan Province. I love various kinds of sports. I play soccer, basketball, tennis. I also swim, marathon, skateboard, biking. 

I like Chinese traditional poetry. Some poems I like.

春风得意马蹄疾，一日看尽长安花。

I was very ambitious at earlier age. Now I just want to do the work at my hand well.

三十功名尘与土，八千里路云和月。莫等闲，白了少年头，空悲切。

Never lose your heart. Man, go and pursue your dream!
